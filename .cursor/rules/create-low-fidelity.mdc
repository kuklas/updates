# Low-Fidelity Prototype Rule

## Purpose
This rule defines how to create low-fidelity prototypes that are intentionally less polished to focus on functionality and flow rather than visual design.

## When to Apply
Apply this rule when:
- The user explicitly requests a "low-fidelity" or "lo-fi" prototype
- The user wants to focus on functionality over aesthetics
- Creating rapid prototypes for testing concepts
- Building mockups for user feedback sessions

## Implementation

### Body Class Modification
When creating a low-fidelity prototype, add the `fidelity-low` class to the body element:

```html
<body class="fidelity-low">
```

Or in React/JavaScript:
```javascript
document.body.classList.add('fidelity-low');
```

### Current Low-Fidelity Effects
The `.fidelity-low` class currently applies:
- **Comic Sans MS font** - Makes the prototype feel less finished
- **Grayscale filter** - Removes color to focus on layout and functionality

### Best Practices
1. **Ask before applying** - Confirm with the user if they want low-fidelity mode
2. **Maintain functionality** - Low-fidelity is visual only; all features should work
3. **Keep accessibility** - Don't sacrifice accessibility for lo-fi aesthetics
4. **Document the mode** - Make it clear in comments when lo-fi mode is active
5. **Easy removal** - Ensure the class can be easily removed to switch to high-fidelity

## Future Extensions
This rule will be expanded to include:
- Additional low-fidelity styling options
- Toggle mechanisms for switching between modes
- Different levels of fidelity (ultra-low, low, medium)
- Wireframe-style visual treatments

## Example Usage

### Initial Prompt Recognition
When a user says:
- "Create a low-fidelity dashboard"
- "Build a lo-fi prototype for testing"
- "Make this look less polished"

### Response Pattern
```typescript
// Add low-fidelity class to body
useEffect(() => {
  document.body.classList.add('fidelity-low');
  
  // Cleanup on unmount
  return () => {
    document.body.classList.remove('fidelity-low');
  };
}, []);
```
